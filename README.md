**WPT-Gen** is an agentic CLI tool designed to increase browser interoperability by automating the creation of [Web Platform Tests (WPT)](https://web-platform-tests.org/).

To bridge the gap between W3C Specifications and local WPT repositories, WPT-Gen uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively identify testing gaps and generate high-quality, compliant test cases.

## Forging a Unified Web

Browser interoperability is critical for the web. While the W3C and WHATWG write specifications, translating those specs into exhaustive tests is historically manual and error-prone. **WPT-Gen** tackles this challenge by:
- **Reducing Manual Effort:** Automating the tedious process of mapping spec assertions to existing tests.
- **Ensuring High Coverage:** Identifying missing edge cases and suggesting specific test scenarios.
- **Standardizing Compliance:** Generating tests that adhere to strict WPT style guides and directory structures.

## Key Features

*   **Context Assembly:** Automatically resolves Web Feature IDs (via `web-features`) to fetch specification and MDN documentation (if available), using BeautifulSoup and Markdownify to preserve critical code blocks and semantic structure.
*   **Deep Local Analysis:** Scans your local WPT repository using `WEB_FEATURES.yml` metadata to identify existing tests and their dependencies.
*   **Gap Analysis:** Compares technical requirements synthesized from specifications against current test coverage to pinpoint missing assertions.
*   **Test Suggestions:** Brainstorms specific, actionable test scenarios (test suggestions) that address identified gaps.
*   **Automated Generation:** Produces atomic, WPT-compliant HTML and JavaScript test files based on user-approved test suggestions using an autonomous agent powered by `google-adk`.
*   **Multi-Provider Support:** Built-in support for Google Gemini (via `google-genai` and thinking models), OpenAI, and Anthropic models.

**Also for ChromeStatus Integration:** Optionally, you can provide a ChromeStatus feature ID instead of a Web Feature ID. This pulls data directly from the ChromeStatus API (`chromestatus.com`) to drive the requirements extraction and coverage audit phases.

## How it Works

WPT-Gen follows a structured, multi-phase agentic workflow. Each phase is designed to build upon the last, culminating in high-quality, verified test cases.

### Workflow Phases

For an in-depth explanation of the internal logic, inputs, outputs, and LLM integrations for each phase, see the [Workflow Phases Documentation](docs/workflow-phases.md).

1.  **Phase 1: Context Assembly:** Aggregates the "Source of Truth" from external documentation (W3C Specs, MDN) or ChromeStatus feature entries, and identifies existing test coverage in the local WPT repository.
2.  **Phase 2: Requirements Extraction:** Uses an LLM to synthesize specification text into structured, granular technical requirements. Supports parallel and iterative extraction modes for complex specs.
3.  **Phase 3: Coverage Audit:** Performs a delta analysis by comparing the synthesized requirements against the local test suite. This phase outputs an audit worksheet and high-level test suggestions.
4.  **Phase 4: Test Generation:** Translates user-selected test suggestions into functional WPT-compliant code (Testharness, Reftests, or Crashtests) using an autonomous agent powered by `google-adk`, which leverages specialized file-system tools and style guide instructions.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.10+**
*   **Local WPT Repository:** A local checkout of [web-platform-tests/wpt](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt).
*   **API Key:** An API key for a supported LLM (Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic).

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install wpt-gen
```

### From Source (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpt-gen.git
cd wpt-gen

# Install the package (using a virtual environment is recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make install
```

## Configuration

WPT-Gen uses a combination of a YAML configuration file and environment variables.

### 1. Environment Variables
You must export the API key for your chosen provider. These are never stored on disk.

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
# OR
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
# OR
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
```

### 2. YAML Configuration (`wpt-gen.yml`)
Run `wpt-gen init` to generate a `wpt-gen.yml` configuration file with sensible defaults:

```bash
wpt-gen init --wpt-path /path/to/your/local/wpt
```

This will create a configuration file that looks like this:

```yaml
default_provider: gemini
wpt_path: /path/to/your/local/wpt  # Path to your local WPT checkout

providers:
  gemini:
    default_model: gemini-3.1-pro-preview
    categories:
      lightweight: gemini-3-flash-preview
      reasoning: gemini-3.1-pro-preview
  openai:
    default_model: gpt-5.2-high
    categories:
      lightweight: gpt-5-mini
      reasoning: gpt-5.2-high
  anthropic:
    default_model: claude-opus-4-6
    categories:
      lightweight: claude-sonnet-4-6
      reasoning: claude-opus-4-6


phase_model_mapping:
  requirements_extraction: reasoning
  coverage_audit: reasoning
  generation: lightweight
```

### 3. Managing Configuration via CLI
You can use the built-in `config` command group to view or modify your settings without opening the YAML file manually.

- **View Configuration:**
  ```bash
  wpt-gen config show
  ```
- **Update Configuration:** Use dot-notation to set specific values.
  ```bash
  wpt-gen config set default_provider "openai"
  wpt-gen config set providers.gemini.default_model "gemini-3.1-pro-preview"
  ```

## Usage

The primary interface is the `generate` command, which requires a **Web Feature ID** (as defined in the [web-features](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features) repository).

### Basic Generation

```bash
wpt-gen generate font-family
```

### Common Options

| Option | Shorthand | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `web_feature_id` | (Arg) | **Required.** The ID of the feature (e.g., `font-family`, `popover`). |
| `--provider` | `-p` | Override the default LLM provider (`gemini`, `openai`, `anthropic`). |
| `--wpt-dir` | `-w` | Override the path to the local web-platform-tests repository. |
| `--draft` | | Enable fetching metadata from the draft features directory. |
| `--config` | `-c` | Path to a custom `wpt-gen.yml` file. |

**Note:** You can run `wpt-gen generate --help` to see a full list of all 20+ options (including manual overrides). For more detailed information, see the [CLI Command Reference](docs/cli.md).

### Single Test Generation

The `generate-single` command allows you to bypass the audit phases and directly generate a single WPT test from a behavior description.

```bash
wpt-gen generate-single "description of the behavior to test" --spec-urls https://example.com/spec
```

### Common Options

| Option | Shorthand | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `description` | (Arg) | **Required.** The specific behavior description to test. |
| `--spec-urls` | | Comma-separated list of specification URLs for the feature. **(Required if `--web-feature-id` is not provided)** |
| `--web-feature-id` | `-f` | Optional web feature ID (e.g., `grid`, `popover`). **(Required if `--spec-urls` is not provided)** |
| `--title` | `-t` | Optional title for the test suggestion. |
| `--test-type` | | Optional test type (e.g., `testharness`, `wdspec`). |
| `--provider` | `-p` | Override the default LLM provider. |
| `--wpt-dir` | `-w` | Override the path to the local web-platform-tests repository. |

## ChromeStatus Usage

The `chromestatus` command allows for a more targeted workflow by leveraging ChromeStatus feature entries directly. This is useful for features that may not yet be fully represented in the `web-features` repository.

### Basic Generation

```bash
wpt-gen chromestatus <feature_id>
```

### Common Options

| Option | Shorthand | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `feature_id` | (Arg) | **Required.** The numeric ID of the ChromeStatus feature. |
| `--provider` | `-p` | Override the default LLM provider. |
| `--wpt-dir` | `-w` | Override the path to the local web-platform-tests repository. |
| `--config` | `-c` | Path to a custom `wpt-gen.yml` file. |

**Note:** The `chromestatus` command fetches data from `chromestatus.com/api/v0/features/{feature_id}` and uses the feature's name and summary to drive the requirements extraction and coverage audit phases.

## Other Commands

*   `wpt-gen audit`: Perform a gap analysis and generate coverage blueprints without generating WPT files.
*   `wpt-gen clear-cache`: Clear the existing cached data for wpt-gen.
*   `wpt-gen config`: Manage WPT-Gen configuration.
*   `wpt-gen doctor`: Verify that all system prerequisites are met.

## Development

### Running Tests
We use `pytest` for unit and integration testing. Run tests easily via:

```bash
make test
```

### Linting & Formatting
We use `ruff` to maintain code quality and `mypy` for type checking. You can run these using `make` commands:

```bash
# Lint and format
make lint-fix

# Type check
make typecheck

# Run all checks (format, lint, typecheck, tests)
make check

# Prepare for PR (runs lint-fix, typecheck, and test)
make presubmit
```

### Release Process

WPT-Gen utilizes a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions. Creating and publishing a new **GitHub Release** (e.g., `v1.0.0`) automatically triggers the `publish.yml` workflow, which securely builds and uploads the package to PyPI. For more details, see the [Contributing Guide](docs/contributing.md).
